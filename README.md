## Object -

object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair is called a property.<br>
The key of a property can be a string. And the value of a property can be any value, e.g., a string, a number, an array, and even a function.<br>
JavaScript provides  many ways to create an object. most commonly used one is to use the object literal notation.

## Creating a JavaScript Object -

1.Create a single object, using an object literal.<br>
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
2.Create a single object, with the keyword new.<br>
const person = new Object();
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue";

3.Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.<br>
4.Create an object using Object.create().
